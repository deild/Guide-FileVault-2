## Implications & Conclusion

### Properly Encrypted Data Can Defeat Any Adversary

When the data on the disk is properly encrypted, such data cannot be accessed by any adversary. However, that alone isn’t enough.

We also need to establish the following:

* The encryption is strong
* Password is strong
* Password is not stored somewhere where the adversary is able to access

When the aforementioned are embraced and implemented, all adversaries regardless how well-funded and skilled they are can be defeated.

Of course, some additional modifications to OS settings are required:

* Disabling automatic login
* Creating a different password for the login keychain on Mac
* Remembering to lock the login keychain
* Never store the recovery key in your iCloud account with Apple

All of these implementations and modifications will easily frustrate anyone that is interested in gaining access to the data on your Mac.

The only way attackers can “bypass the full-disk encryption” is to subvert your computer by installing malware which is uncommon.
