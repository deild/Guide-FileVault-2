## What macOS And FileVault 2 Can’t Protect The Mac User From

### Cold Boot Attacks

OS X and FileVault 2 cannot defend against Cold Boot attacks. This is because the encryption keys are stored in memory when the machine is powered on. For instance, the moment you entered your password on boot. This security issue isn’t limited to FileVault 2 full-disk encryption, but to all other software full-disk encryption tools. Thus, there isn’t a publicly acknowledged defensive software against Cold Boot attacks.

**For security and privacy purposes, power off the computer entirely when you don’t plan on using it.**
